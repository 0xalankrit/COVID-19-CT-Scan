# COVID-19-CT-Scan
---
### Image segmentation and classification for Covid19 lung CT-scans using UNET implemented in Tensorflow and Keras.
#### Apart from classification, CNN is used today for more advanced problems like image segmentation, object detection, etc. Image segmentation is a process in computer vision where the image is segmented into different segments representing each different class in the image. 
#### Segmentation helps to identify where objects of different classes are present in an image. UNet is a convolutional neural network architecture that expanded with few changes in the CNN architecture. It was invented to deal with biomedical images by [*Olag Ronneberger et al.*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) where the target is not only to classify whether there is an infection or not but also to identify the area of infection.
